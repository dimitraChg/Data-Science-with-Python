# Data Science with Python

Here, you will find examples, in different folder each one, of how Python is used to create some basic charts (like bar chart, 
line chart, pie chart etc.), analyze data (producing predictive statistics and other importand statistics measures), create
statistical plots such as scatter plot, boxplot, histogram (viewing in depth the structure of the data and see if there are missing
or extreme values), find if the data have some type of relationship by calculating the correlation coeficient and final use of some
basic machine learning techniques (regression analysis, logistic regression, naive bayes, k-means clustering, hierarchical
clustering, k-NN classification etc.) in order to find patterns in the dataset.
